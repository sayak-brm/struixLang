## Usage Scenarios:

The most potential use case for struixLang is as an **embedded domain specific scripting language**.

Being so compact, struixLang can be easily adapted to the specifics of the host language and of the intended task. Not to mention its inherent simplicity should ensure acceptable performance even on top of another interpreted language (like this implementation).
