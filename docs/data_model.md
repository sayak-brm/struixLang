## Data Model:

### Supported Types:

struixLang supports the following data types:

* Integers,
* Floats,
* Strings,
* Boolean,
* Lists, and
* Words.

However, the current implementation can utilize words which put or use values of any type supported in Python 3.

Also note that as struixLang is a *Homoiconic Language*, it can treat code as data and data as code, hence **words** are included in the list above.
